"""ActionQueue — priority-ordered command pipeline for the InputExecutor.

Design
──────
Decision threads (MacroLoop, MicroLoop, future agents) call queue.submit(action).
The InputExecutor is the *only* thread that ever calls WC3Input methods.
This eliminates all CGEvent thread-safety concerns and serialises input
exactly as WC3's event port expects.

Priority levels (lower = higher urgency)
  MICRO   0  hero abilities, unit reactions
  ARMY    2  train grunt, attack-move commands
  MACRO   5  build order, train peon, build burrow
  ECONOMY 8  lumber routing, utility moves

Within the same priority level, FIFO order is maintained via a monotonic
sequence counter so two MACRO actions enqueued at the same moment fire
in submission order.
