"""MicroLoop — 10 Hz unit reactions and hero micro.

Phase 1b: hero skill leveling handled by MacroLoop._try_hero_skills (MICRO priority).
Phase 2:  BM harass, kiting, target-switch implemented here.

With ActionQueue, MicroLoop submits Actions at Priority.MICRO — these preempt
any MACRO or ARMY action between steps in the InputExecutor.
