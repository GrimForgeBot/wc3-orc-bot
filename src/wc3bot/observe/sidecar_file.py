"""wc3bot.observe.sidecar_file — Read WC3 sidecar state from the .pld file.

The Lua sidecar calls PreloadGenEnd every 100 ms, which overwrites
  ~/Documents/Warcraft III/CustomMapData/wc3_orc_sidecar/sidecar.pld

Reading a file is instant and completely reliable — no memory scanning,
no mach_vm_read, no Lua-GC stale strings, no WC3 pause risk.

Public API
----------
read_once()   -> GameState | None   (single read, <1 ms)
wait_live()   -> GameState | None   (poll until T advances = live game)
poll_loop()   -> iterator of GameState  (yields every new state)
