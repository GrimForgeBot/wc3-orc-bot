"""wc3bot.observe.mine_workers — Direct memory read of WC3 mine worker count.

The WC3 UI shows "N/5" workers in a gold mine.  There is no JASS/Lua native
that exposes this value.  Reverse-engineering (find_mine_workers_offset.py)
found it at a fixed byte offset from the mine's gold-amount field:

    *(int32*)(gold_addr + WORKER_OFFSET)  ==  assigned_workers_count

Discovery session (2026-05-28):
    gold @ 0x136fc70d0  →  offset +48 tracked [0, 1, 3, 5] perfectly.

Usage:
    reader = MineWorkerReader(task)
    reader.calibrate(mine_gold)            # once at game start
    count = reader.read_workers(mine_gold) # fast, every poll tick; mine_gold
                                           # is used to eliminate false positives

    Lifecycle:
        1. Create once per bot session.
        2. Call calibrate(mine_gold) after the first sidecar read.
        3. Call read_workers(mine_gold) on every tick; pass the current Lua-reported
           gold so false positives can be eliminated over successive reads.
        4. Call invalidate() if the mine changes (e.g. expansion) or gold drops to 0.

    False-positive elimination:
        calibrate() may return multiple candidate addresses that all happen to contain
        the same gold value with a plausible [0,5] value at +WORKER_OFFSET.  On each
        read_workers(current_gold) call, candidates whose gold field has diverged from
        current_gold by more than _GOLD_TOLERANCE are dropped.  The real mine struct
        tracks Lua gold exactly; false positives stay frozen or drift independently.
        Once only one candidate remains it is promoted to the fast-path _worker_addr.
