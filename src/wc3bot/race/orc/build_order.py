"""wc3bot.race.orc.build_order — P1b: Standard Orc Build Order executor.

Build order (based on user specification):

  Setup phase (happens once at game start, before main loop):
    1 start peon  → build Burrow   (Z + A) — assigned to group_lumber after placing
    1 start peon  → build Altar    (Z + S)
    3 start peons → gold mine      (right-click)

  Main loop (tracked here):
    T ≥ 35s       → builder peon → lumber (group_lumber → right-click trees)
    1st trained   → gold mine  (food_used reaches 6)
    2nd trained   → Barracks   (food_used reaches 7, gold ≥ 180, lumber ≥ 50)
    gold ≥ 425    → train Blade Master from Altar

Grid build hotkeys (peon selected → Z opens build menu):
  Altar   : S   Burrow  : A   Barracks: W
