"""wc3bot.action.build_order — P1b: Standard Orc Build Order executor.

Build order (based on user specification):

  Setup phase (happens once at game start, before main loop):
    1 start peon  → build Burrow   (Z + A)
    1 start peon  → build Altar    (Z + S)
    3 start peons → gold mine      (right-click)

  Main loop (tracked here):
    1st trained peon  → gold mine  (food_used reaches 6)
    2nd trained peon  → Barracks   (food_used reaches 7, gold ≥ 180)
    3rd+ trained      → lumber     (ongoing)
    When gold ≥ 425   → train Blade Master from Altar

Grid build hotkeys (peon selected → Z opens build menu):
  Altar   : S   Burrow  : A   Barracks: W
