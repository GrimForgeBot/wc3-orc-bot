# GrimForge Bot

A Warcraft 3 Reforged bot written in Python — Orc race, Blademaster focus.

Reads live game state directly from process memory, executes macro and micro faster than any human hand. No machine learning. No cheats. Pure engineering.

> *Forged in code. Sharpened in battle.*

---

## What it does

- **Memory reader** — reads gold, lumber, food, unit positions and building states directly from WC3 process memory via macOS Mach APIs
- **Sidecar system** — injects a Lua script into the WC3 map that exposes structured game state
- **Action queue** — priority-based input queue (MICRO > ARMY > MACRO > ECONOMY) with preemption between steps
- **Macro loop** — automated build order execution (peons, Great Hall, Barracks, tech)
- **Micro loop** — Blademaster ability usage and unit control
- **Input executor** — single-threaded input dispatch via CGEvent (keyboard) and CGEventPost (mouse)
- **Shorts pipeline** — automated YouTube Shorts production from bot sessions

## Architecture

```

       ▼
   MacroLoop ──► ActionQueue ──► InputExecutor ──► WC3Input
   MicroLoop ──►               (single thread)
```

## Requirements

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- Python 3.11+
- Warcraft 3 Reforged (windowed/borderless mode)
- StormLib (`brew install stormlib`) for map injection

```bash
pip install -r tools/shorts_pipeline/requirements.txt
```

## Status

Currently in Phase 1 — beating WC3 Insane AI consistently with the Orc race.

- [x] Live game state via memory reads
- [x] Sidecar Lua injection
- [x] ISO coordinate system + screen projection
- [x] Threading architecture (ActionQueue + InputExecutor)
- [x] T16 macro start sequence — 0.56s
- [ ] Blademaster micro loop
- [ ] Win rate ≥ 7/10 vs Insane AI
