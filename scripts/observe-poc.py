"""P0.5 spike: minimal Warcraft III observer-shared-memory reader.

Opens the named section "War3StatsObserverSharedMemory" that Warcraft III
publishes during a live match, activates the observer API by writing a
refresh rate, and streams a few summary fields (game time, player count,
each player's gold/lumber/supply) to stdout once per second.

Run while a Warcraft III Custom Game vs CPU is in progress. The script
exits cleanly on Ctrl+C. Read-only with respect to game state — the
only write is the refresh-rate handshake required to start the API.
